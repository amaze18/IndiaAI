Although we have an arms-length list of go-to's, lassi, a yogurt-based drink with a smoothie-like consistency, is the OG summer refresher that comes on top for us. It is the ultimate desi drink, can be flavoured according to your preferences, and always hits the right spot. We know Delhi takes its food very seriously but drinks all the more; here are the eight best lassi places in Delhi.  Burfiwala Burfiwala, New Delhi See On Map Extensively popular amongst West Delhi folks, Burfiwala serves astronomical lassi that will keep you wanting more. They have a couple of outlets across NCR, which are always packed with people, especially on the weekends. The ambience of their main location in Mundka is low-key and traditional, and their lassis come in a long kulhad (earthen pot) topped with thick cream and some dry fruits. It tastes excellent and is a pretty heavy drink, but absolutely worth it. We also recommend checking out their barfis, which are as good and will have you hooked.   Price: INR 70  Bille Di Hatti Bille Di Hatti, Kamla Nagar, New Delhi See On Map If you have studied at North Campus, then this place needs no introduction. Bille Di Hatti is the OG eatery in Kamala Nagar, renowned for its meethi lassi. Every dish is jam-packed with amazing flavours, and we definitely recommend coming here during the winter season to have their lassi and chole bhature. The prices are great, and it's the ideal spot for a hearty breakfast with your squad.

Price: INR 70  Meghraj & Sons Meghraj & Sons, Chandni Chowk, New Delhi See On Map Chandni Chowk cannot be missed if the conversation revolves around Delhi and food. Meghraj & Sons is our absolute favourite when it comes to the best lassi place recommendations in Old Delhi.

The place offers four kinds: namkeen, malai, rose, and kesar, and all of them are a treat that makes all the hassle of navigating through the bustling lanes of Chandani Chowk absolutely worth it.
