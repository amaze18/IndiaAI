    },
    {

      "output": "Yes, particularly when it comes to things like examinations; for example, Harvard has an acceptance rate of 10%, while the IITs have an acceptance rate of 0.001%, making it an intensely competitive society."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do you reconcile the worship of goddesses in Hinduism with the societal preference for sons?",

      "output": "I think India has managed to straddle the middle and walk on this tightrope, and it's a result of its ability to educate big powers on how to live with contradictions."

    },
    {
      "input": "How do you think India's stance on global issues should be communicated to other countries?",
      "output": "It needs to be put across in a way that's perhaps less belligerent or hostile to other countries and much more willing to accommodate everyone's concerns and point of view."

      "output": "Yes, the West no longer dismisses a country like India and the Global South anymore like it once used to, and is actually listening to how India is articulating the needs and compulsions of the global South."

      "output": "Ukraine wasn't happy with the declaration, but they'll probably end up swallowing their disappointment because the rest of the countries that went along with the Declaration account for an enormously large percentage of their own support base."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why did the G7, Europe, and America support the Declaration?",
      "output": "They wanted the G20 presidency to be successful, and if India had not produced a communique, it would have been India's failure and another country's victory."

    {
      "input": "Why did Nehru prefer the name 'India' over 'Bharat'?",
      "output": "Nehru understood that keeping the name 'India' established the country as a successor state to the British Raj, and that 'India' is a name with a long history and various associations."

      "input": "What's the connection between the name India and the term Hindu?",
      "output": "The term Hindu comes from the same etymology as the name India, and if you abolish the name India, you'd have to abolish the term Hindu as well."

      "input": "What's the proposed solution of introducing Bharat as a second name for India?",
      "output": "The idea is to introduce Bharat more prominently in the national discourse, but keep India as the official name for international purposes, similar to how Germany is known as Deutschland in German and Germany in English."

      "input": "What's the potential issue with officially changing the name to Bharat?",
      "output": "If India is officially changed to Bharat, Pakistan might lay claim to the name India, which would be a major irony."
    },
    {
      "input": "What's your interpretation of the proposal?",
      "output": "I think the proposal is pointless, as we already have the right to use both names, and it's just an attempt to introduce Bharat into the public discourse."
    },
    {
      "input": "What's your take on the president's use of 'Bharat' in Roman letters?",
      "output": "It made no sense, as the president should be referred to as the president of India, not Bharat, according to article 52 of the Constitution."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think the BJP is pushing this nativist assertion?",
      "output": "It's a weapon of mass distraction, taking us away from real problems like unemployment, and a way to promote the ruling party."

      "output": "They spent 10 times more than the Germans, despite having one-seventh the per capita income, and plastered Mr. Modi's picture everywhere, every 50 meters in Delhi."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think this publicity will have an impact on the upcoming general election?",
      "output": "We'll see how effective it is when the voters cast their ballots, but it's clear that the BJP is using events like the Cricket World Cup and G20 summit as instruments of publicity."

      "output": "Kerala has the most advanced labor rights in the country, which can make it challenging to do business, but this is a criticism that needs to be taken seriously and considered from different perspectives."

      "input": "What lessons can Kerala teach others, despite facing criticism and challenges?",
      "output": "Kerala's unique blend of communist ideology and capitalist practices, as well as its strong labor rights, offer valuable lessons for others, but these need to be carefully considered and evaluated."

    },
    {
      "input": "How should criticism of Kerala be addressed?",
      "output": "All criticism should be taken seriously, and we should look behind it to understand what people are saying and see whether the concerns can be addressed."
    },
    {
      "input": "What are the illusions of the 'Kerala model'?",
      "output": "While Kerala has a high literacy rate and well-organized civil society, its growth and development are also sustained by remittances from exported labor, which is a concern."

    {
      "input": "What would happen if remittances from abroad stopped?",
      "output": "The day those countries decide they don't need Keralites anymore, Kerala's higher ranking in the human development index would be unsustainable."
    },
    {
      "input": "What would happen to Kerala if other countries no longer needed its expatriates?",
      "output": "We would be in very serious trouble, and we should use this window to create institutions and practices that would make Kerala viable even if all our expatriates had to come back."
    },
    {
      "input": "How does the Congress party's Centrist approach relate to Hindu consciousness?",

    {
      "input": "Why has the Congress party not been able to harness the grievances of aspirational people in Bharat?",
      "output": "I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask, but I believe you can't win the argument with Hindutva from a purely secular standpoint, and you need to enter into the discourse to argue that Hindutva is a distortion of real Hinduism."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do you distinguish between the Hinduism of the RSS and the Hinduism of the vast majority of Hindus in India?",
      "output": "I believe the Hinduism of the vast majority of people who've grown up in the Hindu faith in India is a very inclusive Hinduism, unlike the Hinduism practiced by the RSS, which reduces the faith to petty parochialism."
    },
    {
      "input": "What is your take on the current state of Hinduism in India?",
      "output": "The Hindu movement has reduced the faith to something akin to British football hooliganism, where people are more focused on petty parochialism rather than the inclusive and majestic aspects of the faith."

      "input": "How do you respond to critics who say that the Congress party's approach to secularism is flawed?",
      "output": "I don't accept the notion that vote bank politics is an exclusively Congress failing, as every party has played this game, appealing to certain castes, linguistic groups, or religious groups."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think the Congress party's approach to appeasing conservative elements in Muslim communities has been effective?",
      "output": "No, I think the shelf life of that approach has ended, and it's clear that the party needs to move beyond it, especially considering the significant shift in voting patterns since the 90s."

      "output": "We would like to remain the party of all Indians, where every Muslim, Hindu, and person of any religious origin feels safe and included."
    },
    {
      "input": "What is the controversy surrounding the term 'Bharat'?",
      "output": "The controversy arises from the BJP's deliberate mixing up of the terms 'Bharat' and 'India', particularly when speaking in Hindi, which creates a problem."
