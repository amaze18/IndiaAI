    },
    {
      "input": "What was your experience like visiting Kashmir to learn about saffron production?",
      "output": "It was a special journey, but also eye-opening, as the reality of saffron fields in Kashmir was quite different from the expectations created by Google images."
    },
    {
      "input": "What do you think about the cultivation and farming of ingredients like saffron?",
      "output": "Growers come to understand that cultivation and farming are difficult and arduous, especially for saffron, which has been affected by climate change, leading to decreased production every year."

    },
    {
      "input": "How do you describe the smell of agar wood in your book?",
      "output": "I use words like earthy and grassy to describe it, and I try to help readers imagine the scent through my descriptions."

    },
    {
      "input": "Can synthetic perfumes mimic natural scents?",

    },
    {
      "input": "What's your take on the natural vs synthetic debate in perfumery?",
      "output": "I think the dichotomy between natural and synthetic is a created one, and both are important. You need both, and they're not going to replace traditional perfumery or natural fragrances."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why are natural fragrances becoming less sustainable?",

    {
      "input": "How much of the appeal of elemental fragrances is universal versus cultural or marketing-driven?",
      "output": "I think it's all cultural. The appeal of certain fragrances is due to cultural associations and history, rather than being innate."
    },
    {
      "input": "What role does culture play in our associations with fragrances?",
      "output": "I would say it's all cultural, and marketing definitely plays a role. When you smell something, it has no meaning to you until you form associations with it."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you give an example of how marketing influences our perception of fragrances?",
      "output": "Oud is a great example of marketing marvel. When you smell it in its raw form, you probably won't like it, but marketing has made it desirable."
    },
    {
      "input": "Have you found any references to scents or perfumes used as medicine in India?",
      "output": "Yes, in ayurvedic texts, the line between beauty and medicine is blurred. There are references to fragrances like vea being used to ward off senility, and these smells were also conferred with health-giving properties."
    },
    {
      "input": "Is there a vocabulary to describe the difference between Indian and European perfumes?",
      "output": "I'm not aware of a specific vocabulary, but I think it's an interesting question. Indian perfumes like sugano have a traditional smell, while European fragrances have a different character, but I don't have the words to describe the difference."
    },
    {
      "input": "Is there a vocabulary to describe the difference between Indian and European perfumes?",
      "output": "I'm asking for help to describe how it smells, like the heavier presentation of Indian perfumes versus the lighter note of European ones."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you elaborate on the difference in presentation between Indian and European perfumes?",
      "output": "I think partly what you're referring to would be a difference in formulation, with Indian perfumes often using powerful natural smells that may not be diluted, unlike European fine fragrances."
    },
    {
      "input": "Is the difference in formulation the main factor in the distinct presentation of Indian and European perfumes?",
      "output": "Yes, and then of course marketing also plays a role, changing how we perceive each type of fragrance."

    },
    {
      "input": "Can you elaborate on the characteristics of pine sap fragrance?",
      "output": "Pine is distilled and has a very disinfectant, stringent smell, like turpentine, which is different from the apple-like smell you described."
    },
    {
      "input": "What do you think about the marketing of traditional Indian perfume?",
      "output": "I think traditional fragrances have a marketing problem, they are not as well-known as Western brands like Chanel Number Five, which has been heavily promoted and built up over time."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think traditional Indian perfume is not as well-known as Western brands?",
      "output": "Traditionally, the business has not been focused on selling to consumers, but to other businesses, which is only changing now, and smaller brands are emerging."
    },
    {
      "input": "What can be done to preserve the craft of traditional Indian perfume?",
      "output": "I'm not the person to advise on the business side, but I think the situation is changing, and hopefully, it will continue to do so, with smaller brands and new approaches emerging."
    },
    {
      "input": "What is your favorite perfume and why?",
      "output": "I don't have one favorite, I tend to switch them a lot. My top three are..."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you elaborate on your top three perfumes?",
      "output": "I would pick V... C is one, and then my mother's perfume, which is not something I wear but a smell I relate to a lot."
    },
    {
      "input": "What is your take on the happenings after the nisam's death?",
      "output": "It's a bit like an episode from The Crown, isn't it? Mukram Jar died almost exactly a year ago, and his son Azmat J is now the ninth nisam."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you explain the concept of pretenders to the throne and coronations in the context of the nisam's death?",
      "output": "It's a bit of a tamasha, that's all I can say."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think Indian perfumes have a marketing problem, and how does it compare to European perfumery?",
      "output": "Yes, Indian perfumes do have a marketing problem. European perfumery does a lot of complex work, mixing a lot of ingredients."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think Indian perfumes tend to prioritize a single ingredient rather than mixing different perfumes?",
      "output": "I'm not sure, but I've only come across one or two brands like Sugano that mix different perfumes."
    },
    {
      "input": "What are your thoughts on the blending of natural ingredients in perfumery?",
      "output": "Naturals do mix well, it just hasn't happened yet. I think what you're saying is that traditional fragrances were made with single ingredients, and that's how they were traditionally done."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you elaborate on how traditional fragrances were made?",
      "output": "They were made with single ingredients, in the case of a rose, it was just that single ingredient, and if it was another ingredient, it was that single ingredient distilled over sandalwood, and that's how you got two or three ingredients combined."
    },
    {
      "input": "What makes Indian food so fragrant and potent?",
      "output": "I think it would be the spices that go into it, many of which make their way into fragrance in a distilled form."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do people enjoy the fragrance of Indian food so much?",
      "output": "It goes back to the theory of odor associative learning, which is that you encountered these foods at a time and associate very positive memories with them, and now you really enjoy them."
