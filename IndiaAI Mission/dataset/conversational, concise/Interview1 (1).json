So, when we talk about the five truths Brahma, Vishnu, and Shivaâ€™s truths, for example the mind can only access these truths through its projections. The human brain and senses give us one version of truth. But there are many ways to perceive the same thing, which is why different creatures see patterns differently. For instance, a bird may perceive things differently than a human because their senses are attuned differently."

The patterns we see, whether in nature or in abstract mathematics, are projections of how we understand reality. This brings us to Shiva truth the truth of zero and infinity.

The IIT experience brought more challenges, but it was during this time that I started creating a film about my journey. But addressing trauma and negative feelings without preparation caused a lot of imbalance. A relationship incident and societal pressures triggered feelings of helplessness.

The direct sound, or vibration, in Sanskrit carries more significance and resonates with the deeper aspects of consciousness. Memory and language both store a sense of continuity, but this is an illusion created by the mind. The I that we identify with is just a projection, a product of the mind is narrative, and it keeps us attached to the concept of a continuous self. When we start to see through this illusion, we realize that this sense of continuity is just a construct, and we become more aligned with the true self."

The question Who am I?  is deeply personal, and only the one asking it can answer it, because the complete experience of one's life is unique to that individual. Through yoga, the separation created by the mind fades, and we begin to experience the unity of all things. This integration leads to the understanding that all experiences, whether good or bad, are just part of the story we carry, and the real freedom comes when we recognize that the story does not define us."

The path of devotion is about surrendering the ego and recognizing that the divine is greater than the individual self. Both paths lead to the realization that the burden of the story, whether it is about success or failure, is still a burden.

The real meditation is to observe these thoughts as if they are scenes on a screen, without getting caught up in them. The ego plays a major role in this process fear arises when the ego is threatened, and pleasure arises when the ego feels inflated. The attachment to possessions or relationships creates happiness when they grow and sorrow when they diminish. This duality of positive and negative is inherent in the universe it is a necessary force for the world to function. But the real truth lies beyond this duality, in the recognition that we are not the story or the experiences. By understanding this, we can unload the burden that the mind creates."

For example, the sound Om is a symbol that represents the three states of consciousness waking, dreaming, and deep sleep and the fourth transcendental state. The curve in the Om symbol can even be studied mathematically, representing dimensions and changes in the x and y axes. Symbols serve as a bridge between the spiritual and scientific understanding, as they encapsulate deep truths in a simple form. Even in something like a logo, the symbol carries psychological meaning, shaping how we interpret it.

Om itself is a powerful symbol representing the essence of the universe. Even in a scientific context, these symbols carry meaning, because they are connected to universal truths. The mathematical and scientific aspects of symbols like Om demonstrate how spiritual concepts and scientific principles can converge. It is a reminder that everything in the universe, whether understood spiritually or scientifically, is interlinked.
