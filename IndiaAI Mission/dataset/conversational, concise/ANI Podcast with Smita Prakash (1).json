    },
    {
      "input": "Do you create content based on what you think the audience wants, or do you follow your own vision?",
      "output": "It's a mix of both; you want to be aligned with what the audience is thinking, but there are also times when you want to do a story because it's important, even if it may not get a lot of views."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you give an example of a story that was important to you, but may not have been what the audience was expecting?",
      "output": "The story about abortion in the U.S. is a good example; it didn't get us a lot of views, but we felt strongly about it and thought it was an important story to tell."

      "output": "My son, who was five or six years old at the time, asked me 'what's a Jew?' after I finished explaining something, and that was a penny drop moment for me, realizing that many people may not understand the basics."

      "input": "How do you cater to such a broad audience?",
      "output": "You have to make it accessible to all, which can be challenging, especially when compared to the typical target groups discussed in strategy meetings, such as 15 to 45 or 25 to 45."

    {
      "input": "Did you find that your show appealed to a diverse audience?",
      "output": "Yes, even though it was on an English channel, we had viewers whose primary language was not English, and they liked the show because they agreed with our editorial line."
    },
    {
      "input": "Was your show neutral, or did it take a clear stance on issues?",
      "output": "We didn't try to be neutral; it was an editorial show, like the edit page of the channel, where we took a clear stance on issues."
    },
    {
      "input": "How did the shift to digital news change the way news media approaches credibility and neutrality?",
      "output": "In the pre-digitization age, both-sidism was a strategy to attract a broader audience and advertisers, but with the advent of digital news, things opened up, and we're no longer looking at all viewers, but rather a specific audience."

    {
      "input": "What role do you think communities play in shaping audience engagement?",
      "output": "Communities and audience communities are held by some glues like identity, ideology, or an editorial line, so we want people to watch, share, comment, and interact completely."

    {
      "input": "How do you think journalism has changed in the digital age?",
      "output": "We're not just relaying what people in power are doing or saying; that communication is now direct, so we need to go beyond that and evaluate what it means for our audience."

    },
    {
      "input": "What inspired you to blur the lines between different roles in a newsroom?",
      "output": "We decided that an anchor can be a reporter, can also be a writer, can also do research, and we have to learn all the functions of a newsroom."
    },
    {
      "input": "How has this approach impacted your team's understanding of storytelling?",
      "output": "Traditional desk writers who went with me to the field came back with a much wider understanding of what it takes to build a story and greater sensitivity."

      "input": "What challenges do small-town reporters face in getting their stories told?",
      "output": "Their stories never get told, they never make it to newspapers or mainstream media, it's just not of interest."
    },
    {
      "input": "How does throwing people into different roles build empathy in the newsroom?",
      "output": "When you make them do what someone else is doing, it also builds empathy, they understand what the other person goes through to bring something to the table."

    {
      "input": "Can you share an example of how this approach has led to growth and success in your team?",
      "output": "People who are writing stories have been told to manage an event and they've done fabulously well, and they also feel that they're growing, they're not chained to their desk as it were."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think the current TV model is contributing to the credibility problem in television news?",
      "output": "I agree to some extent, as the attempt to go viral can lead to making a mockery of ourselves, resulting in a credibility crisis."
    },
    {
      "input": "What do you think is the root cause of this credibility crisis?",
      "output": "I feel it stems from a leadership crisis, where we're not trying to innovate or experiment with business models or content formats."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think newsrooms lack the creativity seen in social media content, such as memes and WhatsApp forwards?",
      "output": "I don't think it's a lack of creativity among journalists, but rather a reluctance from those at the top to try new things and experiment with different formats."
    },
    {
      "input": "How has the pandemic affected the way newsrooms operate, and do you think it's forced any positive changes?",
      "output": "The pandemic has forced us to make some changes in terms of technology, but I think we would have continued with outdated methods if it hadn't happened."
    },
    {
      "input": "What do you think is holding back innovation in newsrooms, particularly in India?",
      "output": "I think it's a lack of willingness to experiment and try new things, both in terms of content formats and business models."

    {
      "input": "What's the current state of talent in newsrooms?",
      "output": "A person starting in a newsroom is earning less than a domestic help, which is why good talent doesn't stay."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think journalists are leaving the profession?",
      "output": "There's a frustration that kids feel when they join journalism, they're not able to stay on in the profession due to slow growth and lack of work-life balance."
    },
    {
      "input": "What's the typical career path for a journalist?",
      "output": "The growth path is very slow, and the only people who stay on for two-three decades are either passionate about the work or not good enough to find another job."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do you retain talented journalists in the industry?",
      "output": "You have to make it worth their while, considering they have families to look after and EMIs to pay, unlike the thrill of working in a newsroom which only lasts for a while."
    },
    {
      "input": "Have you ever seen a business team prioritize market conditions over talent retention?",
      "output": "In 20 years, I've never heard any business team come and say that the market is in recession, or no, we can't afford to retain talent."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do you approach budgeting for news coverage?",
      "output": "We are always in cost-cutting mode, always. I remember going to Ukraine with a team of four, and we were doing stories every day, trying to make the most of our limited resources."
    },
    {
      "input": "How does your approach compare to international news channels?",
      "output": "I saw International Channels with teams of 30-40 people, blocking entire floors in two hotels, and I thought there's no way we'll be able to match this because we're always going to be short of money and resources."
    },
    {
      "input": "What about the era of American television networks in the 80s?",
      "output": "They used to come to India for big stories with 20-man teams, camera gear, and satellite equipment, costing hundreds of dollars. India couldn't match that, but those networks eventually collapsed under the weight of their own inability to budget their news."
    },
    {
      "input": "What lesson can be learned from this comparison?",
      "output": "India's news industry has been lean and mean due to limited resources, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You should not overspend, and being resourceful can be an advantage."
    },
    {
      "input": "What's the main challenge in the content industry?",
      "output": "It's a business, and we have to look at the bottom line, but we're not ready to stretch the limits of our imagination."
    },
    {
      "input": "How does the pay for content creators compare to other industries?",
      "output": "A flop actor earns more than the top performing editor in this industry, which doesn't make sense since we're all in the business of content."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do documentaries on TV news channels struggle to attract viewers?",
      "output": "It's because we're not investing in them, and people are spoiled for choice, so they prefer to watch documentaries on platforms like Netflix."

      "input": "What's your take on India's international media presence?",
      "output": "We're 10-20 years late in creating a global channel that can tell our story to the world."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do you think India can take control of its narrative?",
      "output": "We need to think big and create a business model that works, rather than relying on government initiatives."

    },
    {
      "input": "How do you respond to critics who say the government should be involved in creating an international channel?",
      "output": "If the government does it, they'll be accused of peddling their agenda, but if they don't, they'll be blamed for not supporting it."
    },
    {
      "input": "What do you think is the main obstacle to creating a successful international channel?",
      "output": "Leadership level people are not thinking big enough, and we need to create a business model that works."
    },

      "input": "What do you think about the Indian audience's interest in international news?",
      "output": "I think the Indian audience is more aware and interested and invested in what's happening in the world than people in a lot of other countries, especially in the West."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think Indians are more interested in global affairs?",
      "output": "I think it's because Indians are very politically aware, and we interact so much with the world around us, whereas in developed countries, people are more inward-looking and don't need to know about global affairs."
    },
    {
      "input": "How can international news be made more accessible to Indian audiences?",
      "output": "We have to make the story accessible, if you start giving out results of the midterm election without explaining to the viewer the format and how it is different from our elections, then beyond a point they lose interest."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think Americans are aware of their own electoral process?",
      "output": "I think Americans only don't understand what their elections are about, it's so complicated and the results take ever so long, they themselves don't know."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do you think Indians need to be aware of their surroundings?",
      "output": "Indians need to know because they interact so much, and the police control everything, so there's a great need to be aware."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think media owners and editors understand what their viewers want?",
      "output": "There's a dissonance, they don't understand what the viewers want, and they're busy copying each other."
    },
    {
      "input": "You had a successful show, why did you leave when you were at the top?",
      "output": "I left because I felt I had done what I wanted to do, and I wasn't able to envision and create the team and content I wanted to my satisfaction."

      "input": "What drove your decision to leave, was it a desire for something new or dissatisfaction with the current direction?",
      "output": "I wasn't enjoying what I was doing, and I didn't like the direction we were taking; we were doing news curation, but I wanted to tell the India story in a more compelling fashion."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you elaborate on the challenges faced by reporters in the newsroom?",
      "output": "Reporters have to make decisions like wearing combat clothes or doing a flood story with water around them, just because of graphics, like in a bathtub."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can an anchor decide the storyline in a news channel?",
      "output": "I think it depends on the anchor. There are anchors who are very clear about what they want to say and that comes through."

    {
      "input": "What kind of anchors have more influence over the storyline?",
      "output": "Those who have a clear point of view and can resonate with the audience, even if there's disagreement, the editorial line usually holds."

      "output": "Yes, I remember an instance where someone changed my lines on the teleprompter, and I corrected myself on air and then confronted the editor about it."
    },
    {
      "input": "How did you handle the situation with the editor?",
      "output": "I told the editor that they shouldn't have made changes without consulting me, and if they disagreed with my views, they should have discussed it with me first."
    },
    {
      "input": "How often do you think people try to manipulate or tamper with the editorial line in news broadcasting?",
      "output": "I think it also depends on people not messing with those who call them out, but it's hard to do so when you're already on air."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you give an example of a time when someone took responsibility for a mistake on air?",
      "output": "Rahul Shivshankar took the flack for a mistake when someone fed the wrong name into the teleprompter, instead of throwing the reporter or teleprompter operator under the bus."

      "input": "What's the difference between taking credit for a team's work and taking responsibility for a deliberate mistake?",
      "output": "Taking credit for great lines written by your team is one thing, but taking responsibility for a deliberate mistake is more serious, especially when it involves tampering with the editorial line."
    },
    {
      "input": "Have you ever received handouts from governments or other sources that try to influence the news narrative?",
      "output": "Yes, handouts have come from governments over the years, and it's problematic when they try to dictate what you should speak about or report on."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think the past was really a better time for news broadcasting, with less noise and cacophony?",
      "output": "I don't think so, even though some people nostalgically look back at the past, when government officers used to read the news on India Radio."
    },
    {
      "input": "What was the state of news consumption in India before the current era?",
      "output": "We had Salma Sultan reading out the news, written by government officers, and people believed it was the only news that happened."
    },
    {
      "input": "How has the news landscape changed since then?",
      "output": "Today, we're hearing different points of view, so it's noisy, but at least we're getting various perspectives."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do governments still exert pressure on newsrooms and editors?",
      "output": "Yes, governments put pressure on newsrooms, and there is pushback, but it's a known thing, and it's been happening for a while."
    },
    {
      "input": "Can you share an example of government pressure on newsrooms?",
      "output": "I remember a Ministry calling up to ask what was running on our ticker, and we would argue and sometimes not run it or run both sides of the story."

    },
    {
      "input": "What happens when you question the defense beat?",

    },
    {
      "input": "Is this phenomenon limited to the defense beat?",
      "output": "No, it happens in other beats as well, where access is shut off immediately, and spokespersons are not sent to certain channels."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do you view the current state of journalism in the country?",
      "output": "It's a healthy fight, with space for everyone and all kinds of opinions, despite channels being trolled, questioned, and investigated."
    },
    {
      "input": "Are there enough firewalls in place in TV channels to filter out fake news?",

    },
    {
      "input": "What role does wordplay and virality play in setting the agenda for newsrooms?",
      "output": "Wordplay and virality are basically setting the agenda today, with everyone wanting to cover the story that's going viral."

      "input": "How has the way we consume news changed, especially after the pandemic?",
      "output": "After the pandemic, I've seen a decline in physical newspaper reading, and people are getting their news from social media, which introduces bias into what they see."
    },
    {
      "input": "Don't newspapers also have biases in what they choose to cover?",
      "output": "Yes, newspapers have biases too, and when you open one, you're consuming the bias of the newspaper, but at least you're seeing various things, unlike social media feeds."
    },
    {
      "input": "Why do social media stars often make it to the front page of newspapers?",
      "output": "Because the newspaper editor thinks it's a front-page story, even if there are more important things happening in the country."
    },
    {
      "input": "How do biases in news consumption and social media create a vicious circle?",
      "output": "It's a vicious circle because experts with little body of work can gain followers and become spokespersons for political parties just by making smart-alec comments and getting retweeted."

    {
      "input": "What is your take on influencers and their role in shaping public opinion?",
      "output": "Influencers who commit themselves to doing good work are the ones who end up making a positive impact, but somehow we don't expect much from our politicians, but we expect more from journalists."
    },
    {
      "input": "Do you think journalists are held to a higher standard than influencers?",
      "output": "Yes, at least we think that journalists are held to a higher standard, but now influencers are becoming the new journalists, giving opinions on television without going through the rigors of journalism."
    },

      "input": "How do you think the changing media landscape is affecting traditional journalism?",
      "output": "The TV journalism model is breaking down, and mass communication has become a two-way street, where viewers are giving instant feedback, and serious journalists will have to adapt to survive and thrive."

      "input": "How do you handle the mental well-being of women journalists, including yourself, when faced with hate and trolling?",
      "output": "I try to take it lightly, but it's hard not to be affected. When I saw my name on a 'kill list' during the COVID-19 pandemic, I initially brushed it off, but later it hit me hard, especially when a colleague passed away."
